            <strong>2001: A Space Odyssey</strong> is a 1968 epic science fiction film produced and directed by Stanley
            Kubrick. The screenplay was written by Kubrick and science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke, and was inspired
            by Clarke's 1951 short story "The Sentinel" and other short stories by Clarke. Clarke also published a
            novelisation of the film, in part written concurrently with the screenplay, after the film's release. The
            film stars Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, William Sylvester, and Douglas Rain, and follows a voyage by
            astronauts, scientists and the sentient supercomputer HAL to Jupiter to investigate an alien monolith.

            The film is noted for its scientifically accurate depiction of space flight, pioneering special effects, and
            ambiguous imagery. Kubrick avoided conventional cinematic and narrative techniques; dialogue is used
            sparingly, and there are long sequences accompanied only by music. The soundtrack incorporates numerous
            works of classical music, by composers including Richard Strauss, Johann Strauss II, Aram Khachaturian, and
            Gy√∂rgy Ligeti.

            The film received diverse critical responses, ranging from those who saw it as darkly apocalyptic to those
            who saw it as an optimistic reappraisal of the hopes of humanity. Critics noted its exploration of themes
            such as human evolution, technology, artificial intelligence, and the possibility of extraterrestrial life.
            It was nominated for four Academy Awards, winning Kubrick the award for his direction of the visual effects.
            The film is now widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made. In 1991, it was
            deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the United States Library of Congress and
            selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.[2][3]
