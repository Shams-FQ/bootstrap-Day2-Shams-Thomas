                  <p class="lead">
                    Keir Atwood Dullea (/ˈkɪər dʊˈleɪ/; born May 30, 1936) is an American actor.[1] He played
                    astronaut David Bowman in the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey and its 1984 sequel, 2010: The Year
                    We Make Contact. His other film roles include David and Lisa (1962), Bunny Lake Is Missing (1965)
                    and Black Christmas (1974).[2] Dullea studied acting at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the
                    Theatre in New York City. He has also performed on stage in New York City and in regional
                    theaters; he has said that, despite being more recognized for his film work, he prefers the
                    stage.[3]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>2001: A Space Odyssey</strong> In 1968, Dullea appeared as astronaut David Bowman in Stanley
                    Kubrick's film 2001: A Space Odyssey, which became a box-office success and is recognized by
                    critics, filmmakers and audiences as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made.[16]
                    His line "Open the pod bay doors please, HAL" is #78 on the American Film Institute's list of 100
                    movie <br />

                    Dullea was offered the title role in movie De Sade (1969), playing the title role (the Marquis de
                    Sade). The movie was a critical and commercial disappointment despite a cast that included John
                    Huston.<br />

                    Dullea had success on Broadway, starring in the 1969 hit comedy Butterflies Are Free with Eileen
                    Heckart and Blythe Danner. In the play, he introduced the title song written by Stephen Schwartz
                    (later recording the tune on an album for Platypus Records). The play was a huge hit, running for
                    1,128 performances, although Dullea did not appear in the film version. <br />

                    <strong>Gary Lockwood</strong> (born <strong>John Gary Yurosek</strong>;[1][2][3] February 21, 1937)
                    is an American actor.[4] Lockwood is best known for his roles as astronaut Frank Poole in the film
                    2001: A Space Odyssey (1968),[5] and as Lieutenant Commander Gary Mitchell in the Star Trek second
                    pilot episode "Where No Man Has Gone Before" (1966). He starred in the only American film by French
                    New Wave director Jacques Demy, Model Shop. He played numerous guest television roles from the early
                    1960s into the mid 1990s, and played the title role in The Lieutenant (1963–1964).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Lockwood was a film stuntman, and a stand-in for Anthony Perkins prior to his acting début in 1959
                    in an uncredited bit role in Warlock.</p>
                  <p>
                    Lockwood's two series came early in his career, and each lasted only a single season. ABC's
                    Hawaii-set Follow the Sun (1961–62) cast him in support of Brett Halsey and Barry Coe, who played
                    adventurous magazine writers based in Honolulu. Lockwood was Eric Jason, who did the legwork for
                    their articles. He appeared in a supporting role in the film Splendor in the Grass (1961) and in
                    ABC's TV series Bus Stop (1961). The 26-week series, which starred Marilyn Maxwell as the owner of a
                    diner in fictitious Sunrise, Colorado, aired a half-hour after Follow the Sun. He would star again
                    with Tuesday Weld in his film debut, Wild in the Country (1961), with Elvis Presley. Thereafter,
                    Lockwood starred with Jeff Bridges in the acclaimed "My Daddy Can Beat Your Daddy" episode of The
                    Lloyd Bridges Show. In 1959, he had an uncredited role as a police officer in the Perry Mason
                    episode "The Case of the Romantic Rogue". In 1962, Lockwood again appeared on Perry Mason in the
                    lead role in "The Case of the Playboy Pugilist". In 1963, Lockwood co-starred with Elvis Presley in
                    the musical-comedy film It Happened at the World's Fair.

                  <p class="lead">
                    William Sylvester (January 31, 1922 – January 25, 1995) was an American television and film
                    actor.[1] His most famous film credit was Dr. Heywood Floyd in Stanley Kubrick's 2001 A Space
                    Odyssey (1968).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    William Sylvester was born in Oakland, California, the son of Italian immigrant Joseph Silvester
                    (1899–1941) and his American wife, Gertrude Bailey Silvester (1898–1957). He served in the U.S. Navy
                    during the Second World War, and settled in Britain after the war to pursue his interest in
                    professional acting. He became a staple of British B films at a time when American and Canadian
                    actors were much in demand to give indigenous films some appeal in the United States. While in the
                    UK, he married British actress Veronica Hurst.[2]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As a result, he gained top billing in one of his first films, House of Blackmail (1953), directed by
                    the veteran filmmaker Maurice Elvey, for whom he also made What Every Woman Wants the following
                    year. He also starred in such minor films as A Stranger Came Home (1954, for Hammer), Dublin
                    Nightmare (1958), Offbeat (1961), Information Received (1961), Incident at Midnight (1963), Blind
                    Corner (1964), and Ring of Spies (1964).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There were also lead roles in four British horror films: Gorgo (1961), Devil Doll (1964), Devils of
                    Darkness (1965) and The Hand of Night (1968).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After an uncredited role in You Only Live Twice (1967), Sylvester's next part was as Heywood R.
                    Floyd in 2001 A Space Odyssey (1968).[3] In spite of that prominent role, Sylvester appeared mainly
                    on television and in small movie roles such as Busting (1974) (ironically directed by Peter Hyams,
                    who would direct Roy Scheider as the character Dr. Heywood Floyd in 2010: The Year We Make Contact),
                    The Hindenburg (1975) and Heaven Can Wait (1978).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Among his many television credits were a 1959 BBC version of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar (playing
                    Mark Antony), The Saint, The Baron, The High Chaparral, Harry O, Danger Man, Banacek, The Six
                    Million Dollar Man, Quincy, M.E.[4] and he was a regular on the one-season science-fiction series
                    Gemini Man created by Steven Bochco.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Sylvester retired from acting during the early 1980s, and died in Sacramento, California, on January
                    25, 1995, six days before his 73rd birthday

                  <p class="lead">
                    Leonard Rossiter (21 October 1926 – 5 October 1984) was an English actor. He had a long career in
                    the theatre but achieved his highest profile for his television comedy roles starring as Rupert
                    Rigsby in the ITV series Rising Damp from 1974 to 1978, and Reginald Perrin in the BBC's The Fall
                    and Rise of Reginald Perrin from 1976 to 1979.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Rossiter soon established himself as a character actor in films and television, as well as on stage.
                    He stated: "I think I sensed fairly early on that I was not physically or facially built in the way
                    that would ever fit even remotely into heroic or what used to be called juvenile parts. I always
                    played character parts - right from the start."[15] His first film role was in A Kind of Loving
                    (1962). In Billy Liar (1963) he played the title character's boss. His first major television role
                    was as Detective-Inspector Bamber in the long-running police television series Z-Cars.[16] He also
                    had guest roles in series as diverse as The Avengers ("Dressed to Kill", 1963) and Steptoe and Son
                    ("The Lead Man Cometh", 1964; "The Desperate Hours", 1972). Among his early film credits were four
                    films directed by Bryan Forbes, namely King Rat (1965), The Wrong Box (1966), The Whisperers (1967),
                    and Deadfall (1968).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 1968, he played Mr Sowerberry in the film version of Lionel Bart's musical Oliver! and took one
                    of the few speaking supporting roles in 2001: A Space Odyssey as the Russian scientist Smyslov. He
                    worked with Stanley Kubrick again in Barry Lyndon (1975), in the role of Captain John Quin. He
                    appeared opposite Peter Sellers in The Pink Panther Strikes Again (1976) as Superintendent Quinlan.
                    In 1968, he appeared in Nigel Kneale's television play The Year of the Sex Olympics, an episode of
                    BBC 2's Theatre 625, one of his four appearances in the series.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In Rising Damp, on ITV, Rossiter played Rupert Rigsby, the lecherous landlord of a house converted
                    into shabby bedsits, reprising the role from the successful stage version, The Banana Box. While he
                    was in Rising Damp he also took the lead role in The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin, adapted by
                    David Nobbs from his own comic novels and broadcast on the BBC. Rossiter was given a surprise
                    tribute on This Is Your Life in 1975.[17] He appeared in I Tell You It’s Burt Reynolds, an episode
                    of the 1977 Yorkshire Television series The Galton & Simpson Playhouse,[18] as well as the short
                    films The Waterloo Bridge Handicap (1978), and the Galton and Simpson-scripted Le Pétomane (1979).
                    After his portrayal of Reginald Perrin, Rossiter's non-comedy roles on television became less
                    frequent, although there were exceptions, such as a debt collector in the one-off HTV thriller
                    Machinegunner (1976), and Frank Harris in Fearless Frank, or Tit-bits from the Life of an Adventurer
                    (1978), a BBC Play of the Week.[19]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    From 1978 to 1983, Rossiter performed in ten commercials for Cinzano. The series of adverts was
                    created by film director Alan Parker and, at Rossiter's suggestion, used an old music hall joke
                    where he spills a drink over his wife, played by Joan Collins. In the Channel 4 programme The 100
                    Greatest TV Ads (2000) Terry Lovelock, the director of two of the commercials, said that Rossiter
                    used to refer jokingly to Collins as "The Prop".[3][20]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Rossiter reprised Rigsby for a film version of Rising Damp in 1980, thus achieving the distinction
                    of playing the same role on stage, television, and film. He continued to make a steady stream of
                    film appearances, including a role in Lindsay Anderson's Britannia Hospital (1982).[21] His last
                    television role was as the supermarket manager in another ITV sitcom, Tripper's Day (1984).[22]
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    He performed comic monologues in The Green Tie on the Little Yellow Dog, which was recorded 1982,

                    <strong>Margaret Maud Tyzack</strong> CBE (9 September 1931 – 25 June 2011)[2] was an English
                    actress. Her television roles included The Forsyte Saga (1967) and I, Claudius (1976). She won the
                    1970 BAFTA TV Award for Best Actress for the BBC serial The First Churchills, and the 1990 Tony
                    Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play for Lettice and Lovage, opposite Maggie Smith. She also
                    won two Olivier Awards—in 1981 as Actress of the Year in a Revival and in 2009 as Best Actress in a
                    Play. Her film appearances included 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), A Clockwork Orange (1971), Prick
                    Up Your Ears (1987) and Match Point (2005).

                    Lockwood was a film stuntman, and a stand-in for Anthony Perkins prior to his acting début in 1959
                    in an uncredited bit role in Warlock.</p>

                    Tyzack was noted for her classical stage roles, having joined the Royal Shakespeare Company to play
                    Vassilissa in Maxim Gorky's The Lower Depths in 1962, and had major roles in their 1972 Roman Season
                    as Volumnia in Coriolanus, Portia in Julius Caesar and Tamora in Titus Andronicus. She appeared in
                    another Gorky play, as Maria Lvovna in Summerfolk RSC 1974. In 1977 she joined the acting company of
                    the Stratford Festival in Canada, where she played Mrs Alving in Ibsen's Ghosts, Queen Margaret in
                    Richard III and the Countess of Roussillon in All's Well That Ends Well.[4] In a feature of
                    Stratford's 1977 season, New York Times writer Richard Eder noted "One of the main excitements was
                    the discovery of Margaret Tyzack [...] her work here has been a revelation".[5] Tyzack had been
                    engaged on short notice by the Festival when Canadian actress Kate Reid dropped out, which initially
                    spurred some protests from Canadian nationalists. Theatre critic Robert Cushman later wrote that had
                    the protests succeeded "Canadian audiences would have been deprived of three great performances",
                    noting of her performance in Richard III: "there can never have been a better (Queen) Margaret".[6]
                    She played the Countess role again for the Royal Shakespeare Company on Broadway in 1983.

                    She received her first Olivier award as Actress of the Year in a Revival in 1981 for the National
                    Theatre revival of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? in which she played Martha, replacing Joan
                    Plowright who was ill,.[7] In 1990, she won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play for
                    her role as Lotte Schoen in the play Lettice and Lovage, in which she appeared in both the London
                    and Broadway productions opposite Dame Maggie Smith.[7] The American Actors' Equity initially
                    refused permission for Tyzack to join the New York production, but Smith refused to appear without
                    Tyzack because of the "onstage chemistry" she believed the two women had created in their roles.[8]
                    In 1994, she played Sybil Birling in the Royal National Theatre production of An Inspector Calls. In
                    2008, she was acclaimed for her portrayal of Mrs St Maugham in a revival of Enid Bagnold's The Chalk
                    Garden at the Donmar Warehouse, London, for which she won the Best Actress award in the Critics'
                    Circle Theatre Awards[9] and the Olivier award for Best Actress in a Play in 2009.[10] In 2009, she
                    also appeared alongside Helen Mirren in Phedre at the Royal National Theatre.

                    She appeared in two films directed by Stanley Kubrick: 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and A Clockwork
                    Orange (1971).[11] Tyzack also appeared in Ring of Spies (1964), The Whisperers (1967), A Touch of
                    Love (1969), The Legacy (1978), The Quatermass Conclusion (1979), Mr. Love (1985), Prick Up Your
                    Ears (1987), The King's Whore (1990), Mrs Dalloway (1997), Bright Young Things (2003), and the Woody

                    However, it was as a television actress that Tyzack became a household name. She is remembered for
                    her leading roles in BBC television productions. She came to notice as Winifred, Soames's sister, in
                    the well received BBC adaptation of Galsworthy's The Forsyte Saga in 1967,[11] a series shown
                    internationally. She portrayed the character of Gladys King in Dennis Potter's The Bone Grinder
                    (1968),[12] a metaphor for the decline of the British Empire and rise of American power in the
                    post-war world.[13] Tyzack played Queen Anne in The First Churchills; Bette in Cousin Bette; and
                    Antonia, mother of the Emperor Claudius, in I, Claudius. She also played Clotilde Bradbury-Scott in
                    the BBC adaptation of the Agatha Christie story Nemesis in 1987 in Miss Marple.[14]

                    In the 1990s, she played a major role in The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles television series as the
                    young Indiana Jones' strict Oxford-educated tutor, Miss Helen Seymour. In the 2000s, she made two
                    appearances in Midsomer Murders. In 2011, she joined the cast of soap opera EastEnders, playing
                    Lydia Simmonds.[15] On 13 April 2011, it was announced that for personal reasons she had departed
                    EastEnders and that her role had been recast to Heather Chasen as a result of the nature of the
                    large storyline needing to continue.
